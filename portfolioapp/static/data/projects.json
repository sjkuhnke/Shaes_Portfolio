    "description": "A custom full-stack business website built entirely from the ground up for JMW Transfer Inc. This project involved complete ownership of the design, development, testing, deployment, and ongoing maintenance of the site. The website features an interactive, client-friendly interface with key pages such as a dynamic homepage with image slideshows and service details, a robust job application system with auto-filled PDFs and real-time validation, a reCAPTCHA-protected contact form, and an about page showcasing company values and offerings.\n\nThe job application system was engineered to be fully digital and mobile-responsive, guiding applicants through logically grouped sections, including conditional fields, validation feedback, e-signature input, and calendar widgets. Upon submission, the application data is emailed to HR and used to automatically generate a pre-filled PDF version of the company's paper application. The site also integrates social media (Facebook embeds), uses JavaScript to enhance UX, and serves as a professional online presence for the company with SEO-optimized content.\n\nOngoing maintenance includes feature expansion, bug fixes, and server-level deployment management.",
